Enrico Donadello Amphora,3.2,https://yonobi.com//collections/all-products/products/amphora-280-suggested-retail-price-532,"Beautiful unique vase by Italian artist Enrico Donadello.All pieces are hand-built using coiling and slabbing techniques. The process itself is a slow analysis of the form, he starts with an image in his mind that evolves and changes as the object grows. Once the pieces have been bisque fired Enrico finishes them with glazes or engobes.Enrico is obsessed with colors and he keeps testing different combinations. With engobes especially, he always overlays many different shades on the same piece to make the surface more vibrant and unique. Although he has an idea of what the final result will look like, it's always a bit of a surprise what he actually gets when he opens the kiln. All objects are made in stoneware and fired at a high temperature.H: 26cm W: 20cmShare",//yonobi.com/cdn/shop/products/image_860e0459-c6b6-43bc-9e78-40f17012fbe7.jpg?v=1655211638

Makoto Saito Small Plate,360,https://yonobi.com//collections/all-products/products/small-plate-11-pieces,"Beautiful small plate, handmade by Japanese artist Makoto Saito (齋藤一).Makoto uses semi-porcelain clay as a base, mainly shaped on the wheel, then adds layers of colored slips and glazes with different melting points. He layers each material, considering not only the simple layering of color on color but also the change in color due to the reaction between pigment and glaze. The glaze and polishing create a matte surface texture after firing.In creating his work, he considers the social meaning and function of the vessels and their relationship to food. Since a vessel is a tool, it is usually made with the user in mind, but he also wants to consider something that has or had life just like us that is placed on or in it.This product is certified as safe for use with food.Measurements:Approx. w 17cm  x h 2,3cmPlease note that the glazes are naturally applied to each ceramic piece.
