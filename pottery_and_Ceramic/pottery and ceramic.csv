Enrico Donadello Amphora,3.2,https://yonobi.com//collections/all-products/products/amphora-280-suggested-retail-price-532,"Beautiful unique vase by Italian artist Enrico Donadello.All pieces are hand-built using coiling and slabbing techniques. The process itself is a slow analysis of the form, he starts with an image in his mind that evolves and changes as the object grows. Once the pieces have been bisque fired Enrico finishes them with glazes or engobes.Enrico is obsessed with colors and he keeps testing different combinations. With engobes especially, he always overlays many different shades on the same piece to make the surface more vibrant and unique. Although he has an idea of what the final result will look like, it's always a bit of a surprise what he actually gets when he opens the kiln. All objects are made in stoneware and fired at a high temperature.H: 26cm W: 20cmShare",//yonobi.com/cdn/shop/products/image_860e0459-c6b6-43bc-9e78-40f17012fbe7.jpg?v=1655211638,pottery and ceramic

He layers each material, considering not only the simple layering of color on color but also the change in color due to the reaction between pigment and glaze. The glaze and polishing create a matte surface texture after firing.In creating his work, he considers the social meaning and function of the vessels and their relationship to food. Since a vessel is a tool, it is usually made with the user in mind, but he also wants to consider something that has or had life just like us that is placed on or in it.This product is certified as safe for use with food.Measurements:Approx. w 17cm  x h 2,3cmPlease note that the glazes are naturally applied to each ceramic piece.

A dark gray clay and a bone white clay. The third colour comes from a mix of both of them. Black volcanic rock and sand have been wedged into the clay and spread out randomly in the making. Before the second firing the pieces are dipped in a silky matte glaze with a different outcome depending on what body of clay it is covering.From shimmery white to a warm yellow/brown colour. During the glaze firing the volcanic rock and sand melts, blends in with the glaze and runs alongside the ceramic pieces. The result is unpredictable and a lot is left to chance, making every piece unique. MeasurementsH 32.5 x W 21 x D 8.5 cmShare",//yonobi.com/cdn/shop/files/MalwinaKleparska-4.jpg?v=1698822173,pottery and ceramic

Sofie Berg Wood fired Teapot no.2,1.4,https://yonobi.com//collections/all-products/products/wood-fired-teapot-no-2,"Beautiful, unique wood-fired teapot handmade by Sofie Berg. This is a teapot perfect for two or if you want a lot of tea for yourself that stays warm for a longer time.The material is stoneware and hand-thrown. The teapot is fired in a kiln, built by herself, and fired with wood. The ceramic pieces stacked inside the kiln consist of just clay. No glaze is used. The process takes a whole day of constantly adding wood to the fire. During the firing, ash from the wood covers the ceramics and melts down to a glaze. In the end, she throws salt into the kiln. It reacts with the clay and also creates a glaze. The firing is finished when she has reached a temperature of 1280-1290°C. This process creates ceramic pieces consisting of just clay, ash, and salt - natural materials. Every object is unique due to its placement in the kiln and the amount of ash and salt attached to it. The kiln Sofie has built is small, and the process is long, which limits collections of wood-fired pieces.Due to the nature of handmade ceramics, all sizes and glaze colors are subject to small variations.This product is certified as safe to use with food.MeasurementsH 14cmShare",//yonobi.com/cdn/shop/files/JoeChristophersonYonobi-26.jpg?v=1702447042,pottery and ceramic

She finds inspiration in her surroundings ­­­­– nature, people, and society. Objects or living creatures that she witnesses in her everyday life. The champagne cups are made of white clay and glazed with a transparent glaze, making the clay visible but with a glossy transparent glaze on top. The coupe glasses are a few varying sizes/heights, but that's part of being handmade.

Organic tea and coffee are provided.Language: Danish, EnglishLevel: All levelsIntroducing brand new workshop with artist Signe Boisen. The workshop explore the japanesse technique 'Kurinuki'. Kurinuki is a Japanese technique and can be translated to “to dig out”. Signe explains about the process: ""The process starts with a solid lump of clay, and by cutting small pieces off one by one, I’ll find the shape of my object. When I’ve found the shape I’ll let the lump dry a bit to harden the outside of the shape. That way, I can hold the outside of the form in my palm while removing material from the inside, in order to end up with a container. The process is extremely slow and conscious, and results In unique objects every time.""Ceramic artist Signe Boisen graduated from the Royal Danish Academy in 2021 and works sculpturally and functionally. In creating her objects, she focuses on using her hands as the primary tool. When working with clay, she keeps a constant awareness and respect for the material's quality and durability; with that knowledge, she pushes the limits. The work often has a repetitive pattern in both the production state and the finished pieces, playing with symmetry and asymmetry. Share",//yonobi.com/cdn/shop/files/93CB82DF-682B-45BB-A3C4-9E4E4DFB2B2B.jpg?v=1713443116,pottery and ceramic

In his work, he has been focusing on the primitive techniques of ceramic firing. Every piece is handmade and unique. Each piece is a result of his technique, which gives the pieces a variety of textures and colors achieved in part by carbonate salts.Léon's ceramics have an ethnic aspect, with a mixture of iridescent colors. He likes the contrast between the outer rough and crude touch and pearly bright inner glaze. When having water in the vase, we recommend not putting it directly on wood or any delicate surface due to the lower firing temperature; the vase can create small leaks of water over time. Measurements: 14 x 20  cmShare",//yonobi.com/cdn/shop/files/IMG_2360_0b9b224d-cbee-44b5-8ab0-488968442c0d.jpg?v=1696297772,pottery and ceramic

She is deliberate in building objects on teetering legs with thin textured walls. She is always looking for the edge. Bronwen uses texture as her principal form of decoration, alongside pale slips and glazes. The sculptures are all one of a kind.Measurements:H 32 x W 19 x Ø 19 cmMaterials:white stoneware, white glazesShare",//yonobi.com/cdn/shop/files/BronweGrieves_Yonobi-4.jpg?v=1697331760,pottery and ceramic

A dark gray clay and a bone white clay. The third colour comes from a mix of both of them. Black volcanic rock and sand have been wedged into the clay and spread out randomly in the making. Before the second firing the pieces are dipped in a silky matte glaze with a different outcome depending on what body of clay it is covering.From shimmery white to a warm yellow/brown colour. During the glaze firing the volcanic rock and sand melts, blends in with the glaze and runs alongside the ceramic pieces. The result is unpredictable and a lot is left to chance, making every piece unique. MeasurementsH 32.5 x W 21 x D 8.5 cmShare",//yonobi.com/cdn/shop/files/MalwinaKleparska-4.jpg?v=1698822173,pottery and ceramic

Sofie Berg Wood fired Teapot no.2,1.4,https://yonobi.com//collections/all-products/products/wood-fired-teapot-no-2,"Beautiful, unique wood-fired teapot handmade by Sofie Berg. This is a teapot perfect for two or if you want a lot of tea for yourself that stays warm for a longer time.The material is stoneware and hand-thrown. The teapot is fired in a kiln, built by herself, and fired with wood. The ceramic pieces stacked inside the kiln consist of just clay. No glaze is used. The process takes a whole day of constantly adding wood to the fire. During the firing, ash from the wood covers the ceramics and melts down to a glaze. In the end, she throws salt into the kiln. It reacts with the clay and also creates a glaze. The firing is finished when she has reached a temperature of 1280-1290°C. This process creates ceramic pieces consisting of just clay, ash, and salt - natural materials. Every object is unique due to its placement in the kiln and the amount of ash and salt attached to it. The kiln Sofie has built is small, and the process is long, which limits collections of wood-fired pieces.Due to the nature of handmade ceramics, all sizes and glaze colors are subject to small variations.This product is certified as safe to use with food.MeasurementsH 14cmShare",//yonobi.com/cdn/shop/files/JoeChristophersonYonobi-26.jpg?v=1702447042,pottery and ceramic
