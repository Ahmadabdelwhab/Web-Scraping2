The bowl is unique in shape and color. Cica Gomez is a ceramic artist from Lyon, France. Her work is initially driven by the search for the line. The one that takes shape when the object takes shape and is placed in space. The one that delimits a pictorial territory. Each piece results from research work, allowing Cica to create a range of colors, which she gets by combinations and playing with the diversity of metal oxides. The result is a unique mix of straight minimalistic shapes and exciting and highly detailed glazes. This product is certified as safe for use with food.Measurements:H 7 x 19,5 cm Materials: Enamelled porcelain. Share",//yonobi.com/cdn/shop/files/IMG_3747.jpg?v=1702640921

A beautiful piece for any home.For the last 50 years, Léon has been working as a ceramist. In his work, he has been focusing on the primitive techniques of ceramic firing. Every piece is handmade and unique. Each piece is a result of his technique, which gives the pieces a variety of textures and colors achieved in part by carbonate salts.Léon's ceramics have an ethnic aspect, with a mixture of iridescent colors. He likes the contrast between the outer rough and crude touch and pearly bright inner glaze. When having water in the vase, we recommend not putting it directly on wood or any delicate surface due to the lower firing temperature; the vase can create small leaks of water over time. Measurements: 14 x 20  cmShare",//yonobi.com/cdn/shop/files/IMG_2360_0b9b224d-cbee-44b5-8ab0-488968442c0d.jpg?v=1696297772

A dark gray clay and a bone white clay. The third colour comes from a mix of both of them. Black volcanic rock and sand have been wedged into the clay and spread out randomly in the making. Before the second firing the pieces are dipped in a silky matte glaze with a different outcome depending on what body of clay it is covering.From shimmery white to a warm yellow/brown colour. During the glaze firing the volcanic rock and sand melts, blends in with the glaze and runs alongside the ceramic pieces. The result is unpredictable and a lot is left to chance, making every piece unique. MeasurementsH 32.5 x W 21 x D 8.5 cmShare",//yonobi.com/cdn/shop/files/MalwinaKleparska-4.jpg?v=1698822173

Sofie Berg Wood fired Teapot no.2,1.4,https://yonobi.com//collections/all-products/products/wood-fired-teapot-no-2,"Beautiful, unique wood-fired teapot handmade by Sofie Berg. This is a teapot perfect for two or if you want a lot of tea for yourself that stays warm for a longer time.The material is stoneware and hand-thrown. The teapot is fired in a kiln, built by herself, and fired with wood. The ceramic pieces stacked inside the kiln consist of just clay. No glaze is used. The process takes a whole day of constantly adding wood to the fire. During the firing, ash from the wood covers the ceramics and melts down to a glaze. In the end, she throws salt into the kiln. It reacts with the clay and also creates a glaze. The firing is finished when she has reached a temperature of 1280-1290°C. This process creates ceramic pieces consisting of just clay, ash, and salt - natural materials. Every object is unique due to its placement in the kiln and the amount of ash and salt attached to it. The kiln Sofie has built is small, and the process is long, which limits collections of wood-fired pieces.Due to the nature of handmade ceramics, all sizes and glaze colors are subject to small variations.This product is certified as safe to use with food.MeasurementsH 14cmShare",//yonobi.com/cdn/shop/files/JoeChristophersonYonobi-26.jpg?v=1702447042
