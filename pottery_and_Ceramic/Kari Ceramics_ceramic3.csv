"Four person dinner set ""Dawn""",539,https://kariceramics.com//collections/unique-handmade-ceramics/products/four-person-dinner-set,"I proudly present to you this unique dinner setting. Each color is derived from a standard colour from the collection, but with something less or more in the glaze to create a nuanced difference. The dinner plates are like the Soft Black, but as less pure black is added, tones of brown and 'ash' show themself in a very subtle pattern. The lunch plates are Duck Egg green, a tranquil colour to truly fall in love with. The soup bowls are like Speckled Blue, with some copper added to create an undertone that goes more in depth. Also the manner of application is different, resulting in the two colours seemlessly finding each other... These beautiful organic dinner sets will elevate your home interior. During special occasions and everyday meals, they will surely make each dining moment a special moment. All pieces of dinner sets are 100% dishwasher and microwave safe.This four- person setting consists of 12 pieces.Measurements: Dinner plate: ca 30cm / 12""  |  Side plate / First course plate: ca 23cm / 9""  |  Soup bowl: ca 16cm /6.3"" Please note, all colours in this set can not be re-created.
