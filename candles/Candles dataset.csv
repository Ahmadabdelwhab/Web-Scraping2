Candle Hugging
To stop dripping and prolong burn time

'Candle hugging' is a technique used at the end of each burn where the wax at the sides of the beeswax candle are pushed towards the wick. To hug your candle, put your candle out and let the wax cool for 5 minutes. Then push the top edge of the candle inwards using your thumbs, flattening the candle edge toward the toward the wick. See the video 'candle hugging' within the product pictures for full instructions :)
